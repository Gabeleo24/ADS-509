""Old Phone" lyrics"

I found my old phone today
In a box that I had hidden away
Nostalgia tryin' to lead me astray
Maybe I'll unwrite some wrongs
I charged the battery again
Combinations 'cause my passcode had changed
Opened up and saw familiar names
Now I wonder where they've gone

Conversations with my dead friends
Messages from all my exes
I kinda think that this was best left
In the past, where it belongs
I feel an overwhelming sadness
Of all the friends I do not have left
Seeing how my family has fractured
Growin' up and movin' on

I found my old phone today
Arguments that I tried to keep at bay
The ones who loved me, I just pushed them away
Couldn't tell the difference from the leeches
My closed hand still holds some mates
But if I'm open, it gets smaller day by day
I can't tell if it is pleasure or pain
Trying to keep within my remain

Conversations with my dead friends
Messages from all my exes
I kinda think that this was best left
There, in the past, where it belongs
I feel an overwhelming sadness
Of all the friends I do not have left
Seeing how my family has fractured
Growin' up and movin' on

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

I found my old phone today
So full of love, yet so full of hate
I put it back inside there from whence it came
Nothing good will come from regretting

Conversations with my dead friends
Messages from all my exes
I kinda think that this was best left
There, in the past, where it belongs
I feel an overwhelming sadness
Of all the friends I do not have left
Seeing how my family has fractured
Growin' up and movin' on

I found my old phone today
