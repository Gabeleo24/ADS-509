""Azizam" lyrics"

Azizam
Meet me on the floor tonight
Show me how to move like the water
In between the dancing lights
Be mine, be mine
Azizam

I wanna be nowhere but here with you now
I wanna be one in this space
I wanna be tangled and wrapped in your cloud
I wanna be close to your face

Well, tomorrow can wait, freezing time in this place
Till the sun is away, could be like a magnet on me
I don't care what they say, we can do it our way
And if love's just a game, then come and play

Azizam
Meet me on the floor tonight
Show me how to move like the water
In between the dancing lights
Be mine, be mine
Azizam

Azizam
Azizam

I wanna get lost in your ocean and drown
I wanna be careless and free
I wanna live here in the moment we've found
I wanna be all that you see

Well, tomorrow can wait, freezing time in this place
Till the sun is away, could be like a magnet on me
I don't care what they say, we can do it our way
And if love's just a game, then come and play

Azizam
Meet me on the floor tonight
Show me how to move like the water
In between the dancing lights
Be mine, be mine

Azizam
Meet me on the floor tonight
Show me how to move like the water
In between the dancing lights
Be mine, be mine
Azizam

Azizam
