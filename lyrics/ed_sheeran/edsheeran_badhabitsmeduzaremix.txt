""Bad Habits (MEDUZA Remix)" lyrics"

Yeah

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to you
My bad habits lead to you

You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
We, we, we, we, we

We took the long way 'round
Burned 'til the fun ran out, now

Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this will be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to you
My bad habits lead to you

You, you, you, you
You, you, you, you
We, we, we, we, we
