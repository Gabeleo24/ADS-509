""Being With My Baby" lyrics"

All is quiet in the world tonight
Counting stars and fireflies
And summer sings a lullaby
For me and my baby
On the hood of his daddy's car
We pass around his old guitar
Bet mama's wondering where we are
It's just me and my baby
The world is spinning round
'Cause look just what I've found

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just wanna stay right here
'Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

Driving home by the river side
Wishing I could slow down time
And take a picture with my mind
Of me and my baby
The car pulls up and I'm home too late
We didn't take that interstate
That back road was a better way
For me and my baby
The closer that we get
Oh, I can't leave yet

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just wanna stay right here
'Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

We both know what we've found
So he turns that car around

Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just wanna stay right here
Ooh, hanging with my baby
Hanging with my baby, my baby
