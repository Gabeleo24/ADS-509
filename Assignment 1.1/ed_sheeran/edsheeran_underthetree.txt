""Under The Tree" lyrics"

I'm alone this December
It's the last light of the day
Oh I can't help but wonder
If you feel the same
Oh I guess I'll surrender
To the tears and the pain
And the cold we are under will remain

You were the hearth light, my fire that died
Waiting for morning sunrise

There is nothing under the tree
That I wished for
I want you to come back to me
And be like before
Have I lost you
And nothing will ever fill the hole?
My heart will be here under the tree
Just letting you know

Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm

I'm alone this December
And the long nights, they begin
Still my mind's overthinking
Now whose arms you're in?
And were mine just an afterthought of needing to be kind?
Guess when we're out of sight, it's out of mind

You were the first touch, first look in my eyes
Now we're just strangers who walk by

There is nothing under the tree
That I wished for
I want you to come back to me
And be like before
Have I lost you?
Nothing will ever fill the hole
My heart will be here under the tree
Just letting you know

You were the first touch, first look in my eyes
Now we're just strangers who walk by

There is nothing under the tree
That I wished for
I want you to come back to me
And be like before
Have I lost you?
Nothing will ever fill the hole
My heart will be here under the tree
Just letting you know

Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
