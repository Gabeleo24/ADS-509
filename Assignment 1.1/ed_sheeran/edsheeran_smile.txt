""Smile" lyrics"

Just give me a pen and Iâll write my worries
Now and again Iâll try and not see that you donât care
Taking the time to taste and savour
Lifeâs bitter wine and childish behaviour
But you donât care

And hey, I donât speak that language of youth
And hey, oh not the one that speaks truth
And hey, I lay in this world for a while
When all is lost just smile

Theyâve written the dates and the times to follow
See all the fakes that look so hollow
But you donât care
What ever happened to the youth and culture?
Wear chains and the same fecking Lonsdale jumper
So you donât care

And hey, I donât speak that language of youth
And hey, oh not the one that speaks truth
And hey, I lay in this world for a while
When all is lost just smile
