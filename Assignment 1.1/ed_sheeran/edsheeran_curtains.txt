""Curtains" lyrics"

Can you pull the curtains?
Let me see the sunshine
I think I'm done with my hiding place
And you found me anyway
It's been forever, but I'm feeling alright
Tears dry and will leave no trace
And tomorrow's another day

Hide and seek
I am somewhere, closed away
You won't believe
How long it's been, since I started the game
I can't be seen
And you won't find me today
I've not been this low but I'll be okay

Are you alright? Maybe, don't ask
'Cause you know I never like to talk about that
Keep it inside, yeah, you say I always hold back
And I always wear long sleeves
Is it in your childhood? Something happen in your past?
Well, the sadness, yeah, I promise that it won't last
And if I could, I would try to take it all back
There's still more underneath
And it's when you say to me

Can you pull the curtains?
Let me see the sunshine
I think I'm done with my hiding place
And you found me anyway
It's been forever, but I'm feeling alright
Tears dry and will leave no trace
And tomorrow's another day

Let me see the sun shine, shine, shine
Let me see the sun shine, shine, shine
Let me see the sun shine, shine, shine
Let me see the sun shine

Hide and seek
Count to ten and close your eyes
Try to breathe
See a message and don't reply
Nice to meet, but in reality, say goodbye
Life can be so beautiful, if you try

Are you okay? Yeah, I guess so
But on some days, I feel like I'm trapped in a hole
But I keep quiet, so the ones around me don't know
That the mountain feels so steep
And I'll say that I'm here to help to carry the load
And the outside rays, they are good for the soul
So let's step out of the dark, 'cause in here, it's so cold
The day's not out of reach
And it's when you say to me

Can you pull the curtains?
Let me see the sunshine
I think I'm done with my hiding place
And you found me anyway
It's been forever, but I'm feeling alright
Tears dry and will leave no trace
And tomorrow's another day

Let me see the sun shine, shine, shine
Let me see the sun shine, shine, shine
Let me see the sun shine, shine, shine
Let me see the sun shine
